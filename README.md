# Pinger
Pinger is a Spigot plugin made for v1.16.5 so that you can ping other players using the "@" character followed by their name (Ex: @Bungoh), and it will send a sound to that player.
The color of the ping will also change to yellow, so it is easier to see through in text!

### Releases
You can download Pinger at the releases tab on the right.
